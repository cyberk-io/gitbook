# The Cyberk Way

### Foreword

This book, "The Cyberk Way", was written to record the journey, the lessons learned, and the development orientation that have shaped Cyberk. Just as Toyota has the "Toyota Way", this is how we mark our way of doing things, ensuring that core values and working methods will not be forgotten and will be easily continued by future members.

People might be hesitant to read, so it is written for anyone to read within 5-10 minutes. The writing style is simple, easy to understand, and does not need re-explanation for clarity.

The goal of reading this book is for everyone to quickly adapt to the "Cyberk Way" - The working spirit that makes us who we are.

### About This Handbook

Welcome to the Cyberk Handbook. Consider this the source document for all information on how we work, collaborate, and grow together. It is a compass to help you find answers to most questions about our work culture.

However, keep in mind that this is a living document, not a static text. It will be continuously updated to reflect lessons and the evolution of how we work. It is also not a rigid set of rules to limit your creativity, and certainly cannot replace direct human-to-human conversations. Always prioritize dialogue.

### The Cyberk Story - Author's Words

The story begins in 2012, when I (Anderson) and Huy happened to be assigned to the same university room.

We built our first Android game app together - a game something like battleship; we connected 2 phones via LAN, then they would auto-detect each other if users opened the app. I did the design and Huy coded almost every feature. Although it didn't bring in a dime, those projects marked the first time we made something that actually ran.

**Year 2014**, thanks to that Android app, we had the opportunity to work at FPT Software, participating in developing applications for apps on Smart TVs running Android OS. This was the first time we were exposed to professional workflows like Agile/Scrum and experienced the feeling of building a system serving millions of users globally.

**Year 2018**, we ventured into new experiences: teaching programming. It was during this period that we learned an incredibly important skill: explaining the most confusing technology concepts to a 3rd grader. This has helped me immensely until now when presenting to clients.

**Year 2020**, I founded Skymore, a small company providing software solutions for schools. Or anyone who hired us to write something. We had to manage how the company could survive with a $600 project contract. But for the first time, I had enough money to have a UX/UI intern team paid in milk tea and gas allowance. A real estate sales brother switched to back-end coding and sat in my old company's office (Thanks Mindx a lot).

In one instance of fumbling around on Upwork in the last days of December, I saw my 1-month income written in the description of a 6-hour smart-contract developer job. Immediately, we dove headfirst into learning, scraping everything available on the internet.

**Lunar New Year's Eve 2021**, we had our first job; on the 4th day of Tet, we handed over the first project. I almost worked through that Lunar New Year. But at least I opened up an opportunity to alleviate poverty, and at least the younger ones had more than just milk tea and gas.

**August 2021**, I met Jon, whom I only later found out was still a 3rd-year university student at the time. It was crazy that back then I couldn't even say hello in English. For some reason, we still started the first contract. It was successful, and he raised capital.

This success quickly turned Jon into the first fan; he connected me with every friend he had in the same field. And from then on, I never had the chance to go selling again. They kept constantly finding us themselves.

**August 1, 2022**, we established Cyberk and closed Skymore. I wanted to dedicate all the focus I had to doing one thing: We will be experts in blockchain.

Also in this period, Huy officially joined full-time as CTO, becoming the person laying the foundation for the company's technological capabilities, along with the nod from Jon, an important piece in the founding team.

In 2022, we focused on building a promise to customers: Cyberk will always ensure the customer's project succeeds technologically.

**End of 2025** The Cyberk Way.

To this day, Cyberk has had the opportunity to collaborate with top partners in the industry. And as usual, they come to Cyberk because someone introduced them. Someone worked with us and saw something in us. They became a fan, and they introduced their friends.

Therefore, I sat down and wrote this book, to record the way of doing things for everyone to be clear about.

## Part 1: Customer Persona

### Web3 Builder

**Builder:** Our customers, by background, are startup founders or entrepreneurs passionate about technology, Venture Capitals, Innovation-hubs of a bigtech. What they desire is to create a product that can change the world.

They fear falling behind in a volatile VUCA world and worry they will become a "second Nokia". One day, a startup with a few young engineers will make their business model obsolete. They might also see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; if leveraged, this opportunity will turn them into a tech unicorn overnight.

Therefore, they will not choose old fields, because applications on old technology platforms already have predecessors. And if a similar idea has never succeeded, perhaps it is because someone tried and failed. Thus, they often choose the latest technologies.

Their finances are also not abundant, or their fund for this startup is not large, because their mindset is still experimental. If they fail, they will try again.

So their strategy is to make it very small, compact so that it reaches the target users as fast as possible, then they will proceed to evaluate, measure, and conclude. They will return to the idea and make changes to suit user needs. Therefore, they tend to change ideas continuously.

## Part 2: Introduction to Cyberk

### 2.1. Mission: How We Do It

**Mission: Creating Breakthroughs:** Make technology startups easy and simple!

Therefore, we need to help them create the best product in the fastest time so they can soon get it into the hands of users. Thereby, saving opportunity costs, reducing operating costs, and with the same amount of cost, they have more **Test - Improve** cycles, helping to increase the probability of success.

The product must always be in a ready state when warmly received, when the number of users might increase from 0 to 100,000 people in a few days. To do this, we need to always be ready for idea changes from the customer side and understand that it is part of the product development process, even making a feature and then it never gets used.

Ensure that the system runs well from 0 to 100,000 users within 24 hours. Therefore, the software we make must always ensure "scalability" or recently called "Elastic" - low cost when few users and ready to expand when there are many users without interruption (down-time).

Finally, we always understand the latest technologies clearly to be able to dialogue with them about ideas, helping them not waste time explaining, and we can contribute to the product from a technical perspective. We focus on making this startup journey easy, simple, and economical by helping them master the **latest technologies** and being the first to understand and know how to put them into practice.

### 2.2. Core Values

At Cyberk, we don't have a complex set of rules. Instead, we have a compass with four core values. This is the foundation for us to make decisions, act, and treat each other every day.

---

**Mindfulness (Tâm): Dedication to the product.** Where our mind is, there is our career. If we put our whole heart and mind into the product, we find meaning in the work we do.

**Growth Mindset (Cầu): Spirit of Innovation - Eagerness to Learn.** In the technology field, standing still means being left behind. Therefore, having a "Growth Mindset" (Cầu thị) is a **mandatory discipline** to keep our skills always sharp.

**Craftsmanship (Nghệ): Artisan Spirit.** *"Nghệ"* is the crystallization of "Mindfulness". It is meticulousness in every detail, **pride in one's craft**, and professional ethics that do not allow oneself to create a sloppy product.

**Trustworthiness (Tín):** Is the reason customers come to us, stay with us, introduce their friends to us. It is built by commitment, results, product quality.

### 2.3. Overview of Cyberk

**We are a lean organization** with under 50 members, built on the principle of "artisans working with artisans". This is where we pursue the true artisan spirit together: meticulousness in every product and pride in our craft.

Our development model is based on mentorship: the experienced teach the less experienced, the seniors guide the juniors, the old welcome and instruct the new. We believe that everyone will progress together on this path.

We are also deeply aware that we are living in an era of loneliness, where the wheel of 8-hour work and four walls can make people distant. Therefore, Cyberk is not just a company. We create a community, where sibling relationships are an indispensable part of life. Here, there are not only colleague relationships but also friendship, the bond between family and family.

### 2.4. Service Models

To execute our mission, we provide two flexible service models, depending on the stage and needs of the customer:

**MVP Development:** From Idea to Complete Product

This is a packaged service helping customers turn an idea into a usable product within a fixed timeframe.

* **What we do:** The entire process from design, development, testing to initial marketing support.
* **Who is it for:** This model is most suitable for projects where the customer already has clear requirements, specific goals, and deadlines.

**Tech-Lab:** Integrated Technology Team

With this model, we act as an internal technology department of the customer, discussing, researching, and developing products with them with the highest flexibility.

* **What we do:** Become a part of the customer's team, participating in the operation, maintenance, or development of new features.
* **Who is it for:** Suitable for projects in the post-MVP stage (needing operation, maintenance) or projects where requirements are unclear, needing continuous flexibility and exploration.

**Core Philosophy:** No matter what position you are in, always work with a single mindset: **We are technology experts, the customer's CTO.**

This means we don't just receive requests and follow them. Our responsibility is to play the role of an expert, understanding their business problem and proactively proposing the best technology solution. We think on behalf of the customer, predict risks, and advise them on the most effective path. This is the greatest value we bring.

### 2.5. Cyberk Organizational Structure

At Cyberk, we do not build a complex hierarchy. Instead, we create an ecosystem of high-expertise departments, operating like artisans, collaborating together to create the best product for the customer.

Our structure is designed to optimize collaboration, minimize barriers, and ensure everyone understands their role in the big picture. Below are the main departments that make up Cyberk.

---

## Part 3: Cyberk Secrets

### 3.1. Secret 1: Practice makes perfect (Chăm hay không bằng tay quen)

> "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." - Bruce Lee

The quote by legend Bruce Lee is the compass for one of Cyberk's most important secrets. In a technology world always fluctuating with countless choices, we choose a different path: **Practice makes perfect**.

### Why do we choose this path?

We believe that superior productivity and value do not come from knowing many things superficially, but from **deeply mastering a field**. Instead of chasing every new technology, we focus all resources on a single technology stack and practice it until reaching a "masterful" level.

This requires a big trade-off:

* **We must say "no"**: We accept refusing many potential clients not in our field of expertise.
* **We accept small scale**: We do not pursue spread-out growth, but focus on building an elite team.

In return, we receive a competitive advantage that cannot be copied: **superior execution capability in the web3 and blockchain field.**

* **We master technology**: We understand every concept clearly, from basic to advanced.
* **We master the ecosystem**: We clearly know successful case studies, excellent projects, and those leading the industry.
* **We master limits**: We clearly understand the limits of the technology we use, know how to overcome its weaknesses, and continuously find ways to become the best users of it.

By digging deep and mastering our own game, we create superior performance and value. This is the strength no one can defeat, the foundation for us to build trust with customers and create products of true value.

### 3.2. Secret 2: Immutable principles, adaptable actions (Dĩ bất biến, ứng vạn biến)

In the myriad forms of the web3 world, each customer project is a unique problem ("myriad changes"). However, if looking deeper, we will see there are core rules and components that almost never change ("immutable"). That is database architecture, login features, smart contract patterns, tech-stack, or infrastructure structure.

Our philosophy is to master the "immutable" to flexibly respond to the "myriad changes". We gather all these "immutable" components and continuously build up, optimize them after each project to form a solid foundation named **Cyberk-framework**.

This advantage becomes even greater when we apply "Secret 1" - focusing deeply on blockchain technology. Narrowing the scope helps us identify an "immutable" zone much larger than other competitors. This is the core intellectual property, the foundation allowing us to build faster, better, and smarter. Imagine instead of building a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) from scratch for every customer, we already have a complete DEX frame available, including:

* **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts for swapping, liquidity provision that have been audited and gas-optimized. ABIs.
* **Backend & Indexing**: Backend system and on-chain data indexing services already pre-configured.
* **Auto-deployment Infrastructure**: Environment is almost ready, services and architecture are ready for a system growing from 0-100,000 users in one night.
* **Frontend**: Interface for wallet connection, chart display, and common UI components. Best practices only found in web3. And above all, they have been integrated with back-end, contract, infrastructure.
* **Documents**: Necessary documents for a project, such as installation guides, Architecture design, ERC,...

When a customer comes with a unique DEX idea, we don't start from a blank sheet. We deploy this frame in one click, then focus 100% of resources on building specific features that create the difference for them.

This approach brings superior advantages:

* **Unimaginable speed**: Instead of spending whole months on repetitive basic features, we can launch the product in an extremely short time because most foundational work has been completed and verified.
* **Top-notch quality**: Our platform is the crystallization of countless combat experiences.
  * **Code-base**: Screened, refactored, and tested through many projects, ensuring stability and maintainability.
  * **Architecture**: Proven to withstand load and scale, ready for the scenario of growth from 0 to 100,000 users in just one night.
  * **Infrastructure**: Deployment process and infrastructure have been automated and optimized, ensuring safety and high performance.

Therefore, we need to constantly update market trends to understand what builders need, even before they realize it. Build them in advance and add them to **cyberk-framework**. We build a consistent philosophy on architecture, infrastructure, and software making process. Most importantly, we **build a team that deeply masters these philosophies and tools.**

Thus, when customers come to Cyberk, they are not just buying a service. They are partnering with a team that has prepared months in advance for their very idea. This is a strategic advantage that no competitor can easily copy.

### 3.3. Secret 3: Seeing is believing (Trăm nghe không bằng một thấy)

At Cyberk, we live by the philosophy "Seeing is believing". Instead of presenting, we bring the product for customers to try every day. Instead of wasting time describing bugs, we sit down together to "catch bugs" directly. We believe that experiencing the product tangibly is the shortest and most effective path to turn ideas into value.

**Daily Demo: Product-Centric** Every day, we demo the product directly to the customer. This is not a regular report session, but an early product experience session.

* **Reporting by artifact**: We don't say "almost done", we show the customer the product running. This eliminates all misunderstandings and ensures we never go in the wrong direction for more than a day.
* **Finding the 80/20**: By discussing directly on the product, we and the customer find the 20% of core features that bring 80% of value. Team effort is focused on the most important place, creating superior productivity.

**Daily Meeting: Quality comes from the maker** Quality is not the sole responsibility of the QA department. At Cyberk, quality is built daily.

* **Continuous trial**: In daily internal meetings, the whole team sits down together, puts themselves in the user's shoes, and experiences the product.
* **Detecting problems from the root**: Instead of waiting until the end of the process, problems are detected and fixed right when they are just budding. Each feature before reaching the customer has been used over and over dozens of times by us personally.

**The Power of Flexibility** Our adaptability and speed do not come from luck. It is built on two solid foundations:

1. **Close to customers**: We are always right next to customers, deeply understanding what is most important to them at each moment.
2. **Masterful craftsmanship**: "Secret 1" gives us the ability to execute quickly, neatly, and accurately.

This combination allows us to **work smarter, not harder**. We don't just build products, we build the right products, in the most effective way.

## Part 4: Work Process at Cyberk

### 4.1. General Process

This section details the standard work process at Cyberk, from foundational principles to specific execution steps in a project.

### Customer Experience Journey (Customer Journey)

This is our product development loop with the customer:

1. **Understand & Agree:** Customer poses the problem, Cyberk provides the solution. We agree on the method, cost, and deadline. Clarity and transparency are top principles.
2. **Accompany & Build:** Customer participates in daily meetings with the development team, directly experiencing the product being perfected every day and celebrating small successes together.
3. **Operate & Improve:** Product is launched and has end-users. The Cyberk team and customer care for the product, collect feedback, and detect new issues.
4. **Repeat:** Return to step 1 to start a new development cycle, continuously improving and upgrading the product.

### Core Principles

These are foundational philosophies, the compass for all software development activities at Cyberk.

* **Always ready to handover:** Ensure environments (dev-test-prod) and documentation are always installed and ready from day one.
* **Continuous handover to customer:** Present and demo the product daily to the customer to receive feedback as early as possible.
* **Quality comes from the maker:** Focus on detecting bugs early, aiming for a product that doesn't need testers.

### 7-Step Process

This is the standard work process, helping every member, especially new employees, quickly grasp and contribute effectively to the project.

1. **Proposal:** The BOD team provides quotes, proposals, and estimates for the project. This step will agree on the method, technology used, Scope of Work, and type of service.
2. **Bootstrap:** The bootstrap team will proceed to install the product by pulling from the Cyberk framework, tweaking it to fit, deploying all important components on dev, production environments, such as Indexer, Frontend, Backend, Contract-Sample. They also build entities, APIs, and necessary documents like architecture design, ERC, and Handover document, preparing readiness so the project end is not passive.
3. **Planning Meeting:** The team meets internally to plan in detail.
4. **Kick-off Meeting:** Meet with the customer to present the plan agreed in step 3.
5. **Project Development:** The team focuses on developing important components of the project, meeting with the customer daily and self-demoing the product to find issues. Here, the team will conduct 3 important meetings:
    * **Daily Meeting**
    * **Daily Demo**
    * **Retrospective**
6. **Quality Audit:** The QA team will send a "Quality Audit" report to evaluate the final quality of the project. They will help find hard-to-detect bugs, hidden flows, and evaluate overall quality so the team can arrange action plans and improvements. These Audit reports will be sent periodically, starting from when the project launches the first function.
7. **Launch:** Observe the product being used, find issues, and fix immediately upon detection.

When there is a new request, the process will repeat from step 1.

### 4.2. Important Meetings

### 1. Planning Meeting

Have you ever felt vague when starting a new project, unsure what you need to do and what the final goal is? This lack of clarity is one of the biggest risks, leading to rework, delays, and reducing the motivation of the whole team.

Precisely to solve this problem, the **Planning Meeting (Internal Kick-off)** is organized. This is not a formalistic meeting, but an essential tool to turn vagueness into a clear roadmap. It is an opportunity for all members to analyze requirements together, agree on goals, and define each person's role. A successful kick-off will ensure the whole team stands on the same boat, looking in the same direction!

Internal Kickoff Meeting is the internal start-up meeting, taking place **before starting development**. Main goals include:

* **Understand requirements clearly**: All members understand correctly and agree on PRD, scope, and feature requirements. **Understand the product**: The whole team grasps what the product is, what problem it solves for whom.
* **Complete Planning Report**: Discuss and fill in the Planning Template – clearly assign tasks, deadlines, and persons in charge.
* **Synchronize expectations**: Everyone understands the goal, coordination method, timeline, and responsibility of each role, company expectations, customer expectations, and project implementation method.

Factors creating a successful kick-off:

* Leader prepares carefully: Has clear product overview, masters requirements, and leads the meeting coherently.
* Members participate **fully and proactively**: Everyone reads PRD beforehand, ready to ask questions and contribute to the plan.
* Ensure key members must participate.
* Focused discussion – clear conclusion: No rambling, every part has a final lock (who does it, when finished).
* **Complete Planning Report** right after the meeting: Plan can be sent to customer/Anderson within the day.
* Identify risks and unclear points early to follow-up with the customer in time.

Things to avoid in Planning Meeting:

1. **No facilitator** → meeting will easily dilute, unclear goals, no final decision.
2. **Not reading PRD beforehand** → waste time explaining from scratch, no depth in discussion.
3. **No notes – no clear assignment** → after meeting no one knows what they do, easily delayed right from the start.
4. **Risks not identified** → easily passive when problems occur during dev.
5. **Not sending plan to customer after meeting** → customer doesn't grasp progress, causing misunderstanding later.

### 2. Kick-off Meeting

Right after the **Planning Meeting** and the whole team has agreed on the plan, the Dev-lead will have a separate meeting with the customer. This is a strategic step to build a foundation for effective collaboration, minimizing the risk of misunderstanding each other.

**Main purpose:**

* **Present plan**: Dev-lead presents the plan, timeline, and project approach agreed internally to ensure both sides have a shared vision.
* **Call for collaboration**: Invite customer to participate in the **Daily Demo** process. We emphasize that their early feedback is the key factor to build the product exactly as desired, helping us avoid wasted effort.
* **Build relationship**: An opportunity for the team and customer to get acquainted, create trust and an open communication channel.

> [!NOTE]
> This meeting is the first touchpoint of the development team with the customer. Invest in form, slides, and show professionalism to make a good impression. A favorable start will make future collaboration much easier.

This meeting, similar to Daily Demo, only needs the participation of **Dev-lead and customer** to ensure focus and efficiency.

### 3. Daily Meeting

"Daily Meeting" is the daily heartbeat of the project. This is not a "stand-up" meeting to list done tasks for the sake of it. It is a ritual at the beginning of the day for the whole team to regain focus, ensure everyone looks in the same direction, and protect product quality together.

Main goals of Daily Meeting include:

* **Sync for transparency:** Everyone shares completed tasks, problems being faced, and points out missing things. The goal is for the group to have a common, clear picture of progress and potential risks.
* **"Bug hunting" together:** Instead of the time-consuming test-log-fix-test process, we spend time examining the product closely right in the meeting. When the whole group looks at one place, errors will be detected much faster. When the whole team has grasped the "bug", complex recording processes become unnecessary.
* **Re-plan the day:** Based on results and issues just detected, the group adjusts and rearranges priorities for the new working day together.

Things to avoid in Daily Meeting:

* **Getting bogged down in technical problem solving.** This is a common trap wasting the whole group's time. If there is a complex technical issue, record and discuss separately with dev-lead or expert right after the meeting. Don't let the whole group sit and "discuss" an issue irrelevant to them.
* **Reporting for the sake of it:** The meeting should focus on the product: which features finished, which ready for users, and how the overall project picture looks. It is not a place to list a long list of "tasks" done.
* **Dragging on:** Time is gold. This meeting needs to be fast, compact, and effective, ideally **under 30 minutes** but also shouldn't be shorter than 10 minutes to ensure everyone has enough time to share and "hunt bugs".

### 4. Daily Demo

We believe in "artifact-ism" - reporting by artifact is the best way to report: simple, visual, and no preparation time needed. The **Daily Demo** session is the place to execute that philosophy. This is a meeting between Dev-lead and the customer, where we "show off" and turn the customer into a part of the development team.

The goal of this meeting is to create absolute transparency about the product. Whether progress is fast or slow, product good or bad, all will be shown through the "artifact" itself. Just in 10-15 minutes, the customer can see, touch, and give feedback immediately. This is also an opportunity for us to go through difficulties with the customer, discuss solving problems together, reinforce partnership, and turn two sides into one team.

Process of an effective Daily Demo:

* **Present "artifact":** Dev-lead turns on the product and presents completed features. Show the customer the product working.
* **Discuss issues:** Clearly state newly discovered limitations and issues needing discussion to solve with the customer. Treat them like a Product Owner, the final decision maker.
* **Record new requests:** Listen to feedback. However, if there are requests outside the agreed scope of work, record and report back to the Leadership (BOD) to handle, avoiding arbitrary agreement.

Things to avoid in Daily Demo:

* **Long-winded reporting:** Don't talk endlessly. Let the product speak for itself.
* **Prolonging time:** This meeting shouldn't last over 30 minutes. Fast, compact, and focused on the product.

### 5. Retrospective Meeting

Retrospective is a weekly meeting. Its purpose is for the whole team to sit back together and look back at the project working process to find improvement opportunities.

Have you ever sat in a meeting, had ideas but hesitated to speak out because of fear of being "different", fear that your opinion would be dismissed? That state is called "groupthink", and it is the biggest barrier to improvement. When everyone chooses silence to keep the peace, we unintentionally accept poor processes, hidden problems, and lose the opportunity to become better.

Precisely to break this barrier, **Retrospective Meeting** was born. This is not a meeting for the leader to sit and criticize or to report achievements. This is a meeting **of the members themselves**, the best opportunity for each of us to personally improve our work experience. It is where every perspective is listened to, every concern is respected.

If you keep grievances inside, they will gradually turn into simmering dissatisfaction, while no one knows you are feeling unwell. It's like a teenage girl in love, sulking but refusing to speak out. That silence doesn't solve the problem, but only makes the relationship worse. Similarly, a team that doesn't dare to speak straight, speak true, cannot develop sustainably.

Retrospective is where we dialogue with problems maturely. Instead of blaming, we look at the system together to find the root: which process is making it hard for brothers, which habit is dragging the team down? From there, the whole team comes up with specific improvement actions for the next working week.

## Part 5: Towards a Learning Organization

### Building a Learning Organization

Daily, we have classes always ready at 5:30 AM in the 1st-floor lobby. They are designed to make learning extremely convenient, to the point where people can hardly resist the "temptation" of learning.

* **Seminar Classes:** Are "field classes" set up right when we find a technology, skill, or new improvement needing immediate popularization.
* **Presentation Sessions:** About new technology, about outstanding projects on the market for us to learn from successful case studies together, enriching consulting capital for customers.

**Self-learning:** If classes give us "inspiration", then self-learning turns that "inspiration" into true "skill".

**Learning goes with Practice:** As Uncle Ho taught: "Learning goes with practice". This is when we truly sharpen our skills to become artisans. Treat each project as a place where we get to practice new skills. Always ask yourself, what will I know more through this project.

As long as this flame of eagerness to learn still burns in every member, as long as we still see every challenge as a lesson, then Cyberk will continue to move forward. The development of the organization lies nowhere else but in the maturity of each of us.
