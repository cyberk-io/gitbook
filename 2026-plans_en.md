# Strategic Plan 2026 - CyberK

This document records the strategic discussion process for the 2026 vision.

## Discussion Schedule

### Monday: Goals & Strategy

*Focus: Defining the destination and the core path.*

- **Context & Market:**
  - Web3 is shifting towards the "Institutional" phase (large organizations participating).
  - However, the demand for **Convenience and Speed** remains paramount, for both Startups and Big Tech (when they want to test quickly - Innovation Lab).
  - **Opportunity:** The RWA (Real World Assets) market is booming and requires execution partners with proven capabilities.

- **The 2026 Vision:**
  - **Positioning:** Become a **Top-of-mind Web3 Venture Builder** specialized in the **RWA** niche.
  - **Service Model:** **One-Stop Shop** - Clients only need to work with 1 point of contact for the entire process: Dev, Design, Marketing support, QA.
    > *Value delivered:* Convenience and simplification of the startup process for both Startups and Big Tech (Innovation Lab).
  - **Clients:**
    - **Startup:** Remains the main revenue source (Cash cow).
    - **Big Tech/Enterprise:** Expand to enhance brand position.

- **Core Strategy:**
  - **1. RWA Specialization:**
    - Use Portfolio (Animoca, Oripa, Helix) as a prestige springboard (Social Proof).
    - Build specialized Tech-stack for RWA (Tokenization standards, Compliance integration).
  - **2. Integrated Service:**
    - Affirm the value of "Simplicity": Clients only need to work with 1 point of contact to launch a complete product.
    - **Positioning Shift:** From **Dev-house** (Software Outsourcing) to **Innovation-Lab**. A place helping clients launch startups simply and effectively by providing an **End-to-End** experience (From A-Z).
    - Upgrade capabilities of satellite departments (Design, Marketing) to be on par with Tech capabilities.

- **Challenges & Blind spots:**
  - **Legal Gap:** CyberK is strong in Tech but weak in legal consulting (especially crucial for RWA). Need to supplement capabilities or partner with Legal-Tech (KYC/AML, Security Token).
  - **Valuation:** Need deep understanding of financial mechanisms/real asset valuation to advise clients back, instead of just coding upon request.
  - **Marketing:**
    - **Weakness:** Lack of high-quality Senior personnel; Team lacks experience in running practical campaigns (Go-to-market) for large projects; Mindset of doing high-end service is not yet formed.
    - **Strength:** Deep Web3 Market Insight; Sensitive to trends.
    - **Action Plan:**
      1. **AIO as core:** Marketing does not stand alone but is tightly integrated into the Innovation-Lab solution package.
      2. **AI Leverage (AI-Driven Content):** Leverage the "AI-savvy Developer" advantage combined with Marketers to produce high-quality content at extreme speed (AI Process Optimization). This is the weapon to compensate for personnel shortage.
      3. **Training/Recruiting:** Focus on personnel with "Web3 Native Mindset" to translate Insight into strategy.

### Tuesday: Strategic Partners & Execution

*Focus: Resources and People.*

- **1. Tech Partners:**
  - **Strategy:** Win-Win Connection. Infrastructure providers (Custody, KYC, Oracle) need to find clients (Builders).
  - **Action:** Simplify connection, become a Hub introducing clients to reputable Providers.

- **2. Core Tech Strength:**
  - CyberK already owns the **Smart Contracts Tokenized Vault** suite (multi-chain: Solana, Aptos, EVM).
  - **Technical Standard:** Apply **ERC-4626** (Tokenized Vault Standard).
    > *ERC-4626:* Standard for yield-bearing vaults, making RWA easy to integrate into DeFi (Lending, Collateral). This is a ready-made tech asset helping fast deployment.

- **3. Complementary Partners (Legal & Finance):**
  - **Problem:** Currently the biggest weakness.
  - **Action:** Ask Jon (Advisor) for advice and connection to expert network.

### Wednesday: New Entity & Long-term Direction

*Focus: Sustainable structure and Legacy.*

- **1. Legal Structure:**
  - **International Entity:** **NO** establishing additional HQ entity abroad (Singapore/Dubai).
    - *Reason:* Focus resources on actual quality instead of cumbersome structure.
  - **IP Holding:** Consider separating the entity owning intellectual property (standard Tech-stack/Contracts) for risk management, although currently the value is not yet too large.

- **2. Branding Strategy:**
  - Instead of establishing foreign offices, CyberK will invest heavily in **Image on Social Media**.
  - Build a strong **AIO (All-In-One) Agency** brand in the digital environment.
  - Turn RWA Portfolios into success stories (Case studies) spreading globally.

- **3. Exit Strategy:**
  - **Choice:** **Option A - Cash-flow Only**.
  - **Direction:** CyberK will be a "Cash-cow business", focusing on optimizing profits and sharing prosperity with members. No pressure to IPO or sell itself (M&A).
  - *Implication:* Maintain autonomy, "Artisan" culture, and high-end service quality instead of chasing hot growth in personnel scale.

## 2026 Plan Summary

A **CyberK** of 2026 will be:
> A leading **RWA Venture Builder**, operating under a sustainable **Cash-flow business** model. No need for a flashy office in Singapore, but possessing an extremely strong and reputable **Digital Brand**. Clients (from Startup to Big Tech) come to CyberK because of the **All-In-One (AIO)**, **Convenience**, and proven **RWA** execution capability.
